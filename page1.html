		<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the terrestrial planets.  Unlike
	the other planets in the solar system that are named after classic deities the Earth's name comes 
	from the Anglo-Saxon word erda which means ground of soil.  The Earth was formed approximately 4.54
	billion years ago and is the only known planet to support life.</p>
